This app is written in Java and is a simulator that enables the creation of scenarios with variables and equations and runs in real time for an eventual link to a sensor which would affect the simulation in real time.

There are 5 tabs that can pop out to offer a spread out view: the simulation controller, the variable list, the graph view, the calculator, and the 2d view. There is also a history tab which makes it possible to look at every polled state during the simulation.
